		<h1>Adding a New Tool</h1>
		<h2>Adding a New Pencil</h2>
        <ol>
		<p>
			In this tutorial we will walk through how to add a new tool.
      We will use the tool of pencil as an example.
		</p>
		<li>
			Create a mask of the tool in tool_utilities
		</li>
		<p>
			To start, we first need to make a mask of the tool that we would want to create.
      For the example of the pencil, we will just make it a single,
      non-transparent pixel that completely replaces the existing colors on the canvas.
      Since pencil has a similar shape mask to the caligraphy pen, all we need to do
      is use that same function but tinker with the width and height.
		</p>
		<p>
			<font color=”#808080″><b>src/lib/libimgtools/src/tool_utilities.cc</b></font>
		</p>
		<pre>
void FillMask(double** mask, int height, int width, double opacity) {
  for (int h = 0; h < height; h++) {
    for (int w = 0; w < width; w++) {
      mask[h][w] = opacity;
    }
  }
}
		</pre>
		<p>
				The snippet of code above makes a rectangular shape mask and sets the
        opacity to any value we would like. The pencil mask fits this desription
        which saves the hassle of making a specific mask just for pencil.
        Something to note, we could just make a default constructor for the pencil
        that sets the width and height both to one, but we choose to not have one
        in order to have the freedom to change the size of the pencil mask if we wanted.
		</p>
		<li>
				Create .h file for the tool in include
		</li>
		<p>
				Next, we need to create a header file for the tool. The header file will
        define the parameters that are needed by the tool. In the case of the
        pencil tool, we will need the width and height.
		</p>
		<p>
			<font color=”#808080″><b>src/lib/libimgtools/src/include/pencil.h</b></font>
		</p>
		<pre>
#include "src/lib/libimgtools/src/include/tool.h"

class Pencil : public Tool {
 public:
  Pencil(int width, int height);
  Pencil();
  ~Pencil();
};
		</pre>
		<p>
				Since we already have tool.h which provides a basic outline of any tool,
        we extended from tool.h to get the width and height as seen from the
        snippet of code above.
		</p>
		<li>
				Create .cc file for the tool in src
		</li>
		<p>
				Now, we must create the .cc file for the tool. This is where we will set
        the height and width of the tool along with any other variables that the
        tool may need. This file will also call the function we created specifically
        for the new tool. With the example of pencil, we will need to set the height
        and width both to 1 and call the FillMask() fucntion that we made earlier.
		</p>
		<p>
			<font color=”#808080″><b>src/lib/libimgtools/src/pencil.cc</b></font>
		</p>
		<pre>
Pencil::Pencil(int width, int height) : Tool(width, height) {
  tool_utilities::FillMask(this->get_mask(), height, width, 1.0);
}

Pencil::Pencil() : Pencil(1, 1) {}
		</pre>
		<p>
				There are a couple things to note from the snippet of code above. One:
        to meet the requirments that the pencil be a single pixel, we set both
        the height and width to 1, but this is where we can change the size of
        the pencil if we want it to be different than a single pixel. Two: we
        call FillMask() from tool_utilities in order to access the premade mask.
		</p>

		<li>
			Now, you need to add the Tool to the User Interface. In tool_factory.h, we need to add the Pencil to the Tool Enum as shown below. Remember to increase the NUMTOOLS.
		</li>
		<p>
			<font color=”#808080″><b>src/lib/libimgtools/src/include/tool_factory.h</b></font>
		</p>
		<pre>
  enum TOOLS {
    TOOL_PEN = 0,
    TOOL_ERASER = 1,
    TOOL_SPRAYCAN = 2,
    TOOL_CALLIGRAPHYPEN = 3,
    TOOL_HIGHLIGHTER = 4,
    TOOL_STAMP = 5,
    TOOL_BLUR = 6,
    TOOL_RAINBOW = 7,
	TOOL_PENCIL = 8
    NUMTOOLS = 9
  };
		</pre>
		<li>
			In tool_factory.cc, you need to create the Pencil object as shown below. Don't forget to include pencil.h.
		</li>
		<p>
			<font color=”#808080″><b>src/lib/libimgtools/src/tool_factory.cc</b></font>
		</p>
		<pre>
#include "lib/libimgtools/src/include/pencil.h"

...

        switch (tool_id) {
            case TOOL_PEN:
                tool = new TPen();
                break;
            case TOOL_ERASER:
                tool = new TEraser();
                break;
            case TOOL_SPRAYCAN:
                tool = new TSprayCan();
                break;
            case TOOL_CALLIGRAPHYPEN:
                tool = new TCalligraphy();
                break;
            case TOOL_HIGHLIGHTER:
                tool = new THighlighter();
                break;
            case TOOL_RAINBOW:
                tool = new TRainbow();
                break;
            case TOOL_BLUR:
                tool = new TBlur();
                break;
            case TOOL_STAMP:
                tool = new TStamp();
                break;
            case TOOL_PENCIL:
                tool = new TPencil();
                break;
            default:
                tool = nullptr;
                break;
        }
