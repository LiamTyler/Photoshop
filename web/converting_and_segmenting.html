        <li>
            To save our segmented scans in a new directory, we must first create the directory. To create the directory, run the following command in your terminal.
        </li>
        <pre>
.mkdir &ltdirectory name&gt
        </pre>
		<li>
            Open the MIA application by running the following command in your terminal.
        </li>
        <pre>
./build/bin/MIA
        </pre>
		<li>
            Find the first image you want to segment in the Image I/O panel on the right side of the Controls window.
        </li>
		<li>
            Double click on the image. The name of the image should be in the "Image:" box.
        </li>
		<li>
            Click on Load Canvas. You should see your scan in the MIA window.
        </li>
		<li>
            To reduce noise, Blur the image by changing the Blur Amount to 2 and clicking on the "Blur" button.
        </li>
        <li>
            To segment the image, change the number of Bins to 4 and click on the "Quantize" button
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, find the directory you created in the Image I/O panel and double click on it.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the "Image:" box, enter a new name for your segmented image.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click on Save Canvas. You should see your new image in the Image I/O panel.
        </li>
        <li>
            Find the next image you want to segment in the Image I/O panel on the right side of the Controls window, and repeat steps 4-10 to segment the next image.
        </li>
